    "### Function\n",
    "A Python function is a named section of a program that performs a specific task and, optionally, returns a value\n",
    "Functions are the real building blocks of any programming language. We define a Python function with the def keyword. But before we start doing so, let’s first go over the advantages of functions, and let’s look at some built-in functions that you might already know.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of using functions\n",
    "#### Code reuse\n",
    "A Python function can be defined once and used many times. It’s a great way to keep your code short, concise, and readable. By giving a function a well-chosen name, your code will become even more readable because the function name directly explains what will happen. This way, others (or future you) can read your code, and without looking at all of it, understand what it’s doing anyway because of the well-chosen function names.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "Functions accept a parameter, and you’ll see how this works in a moment. The big advantage here, is that you can alter the behavior of the function by changing the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Return values\n",
    "A function can return a value. This value is often the result of some calculation or operation. In fact, a Python function can even return multiple values."

    "Return values\n",
    "A function can return a value. This value is often the result of some calculation or operation. In fact, a Python function can even return multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in Python functions\n",
    "Before we start defining functions ourselves, we’ll look at some of Python’s built-in functions. Let’s start with the most well known built-in function, called print:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print('Hello, readers!')\n",
    "Hello, readers!\n",
    ">>> print(15)\n",
    "15\n",
    "Print takes an argument and prints it to the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in our definition, functions can optionally return a value. However, print does not return anything. Because it prints something to the screen, it might look like it does, but it doesn’t. We can check this by assigning the result of a print statement to a Python variable:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> result = print('Hello')\n",
    "Hello\n",
    ">>> print(result)\n",
    "None\n",
    "None is a special type of value in Python, basically meaning ‘nothing.’\n",
    "\n",
    "Another built-in function, that does return a value, is len(). It returns the length of whatever you feed it:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> mylength = len('Hello')\n",
    ">>> print(mylength)\n",
    "5\n",
    "Creating a Python function\n",
    "Now that we know how to use a function, let’s create a simple one ourselves. To do so, we use Python’s def keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def say_hi():\n",
    "...     print('Hi!')\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> say_hi()\n",
    "Hi!\n",
    "It’s just a few lines, but a lot is going on. Let’s dissect this:\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we see the keyword def, which is Python’s keyword to define a function.\n",
    "Next comes our function name, say_hi.\n",
    "Then we encounter two parentheses, (), which indicate that this function does not accept any parameters (unlike print and len).\n",
    "We end the line with a colon (:)\n",
    "And finally, we bump into a feature that sets Python apart from many other programming languages: indentation.\n",
    "Indentation\n",
    "Python uses indentation to distinguish blocks of code that belong together. Consecutive lines with equal indentation are part of the same block of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "To tell Python that the following lines are the body of our function, we need to indent them. You indent lines with the TAB key on your keyboard. In Python, it’s good style to use four spaces for indentation. The entire Python community does so. The Python interactive shell (REPL) and all decent editors will automatically indent with four spaces if you hit the TAB key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our function: it has only one line of code in its body, the print command. After it, we hit enter one extra time to let the Python REPL know that this is the end of the function. Finally, we can call our function with say_hi().\n",
    "\n",
    "Python function parameters and arguments\n",
    "We can make this more interesting by allowing an argument to be passed to our function. Again we define a function with def, but we add a variable name between the parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def say_hi(name):\n",
    "...     print('Hi', name)\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> say_hi('Erik')\n",
    "Hi Erik\n",
    "Our function now accepts a value, which gets assigned to the variable name. We call such variables the parameter, while the actual value we provide (‘Erik’) is called the argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters and arguments\n",
    "A Python function can have parameters. The values we pass through these parameters are called arguments.\n",
    "As you can see, print() accepts multiple arguments, separated by a comma. This allows us to print both ‘hi’ and the provided name. For our convenience, print() automatically puts a space between the two strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python function with multiple arguments\n",
    "Let’s make this even wilder and define a function with multiple arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def welcome(name, location):\n",
    "...     print(\"Hi\", name, \"welcome to\", location)\n",
    "...\n",
    ">>> welcome('Erik', 'this tutorial')\n",
    "Hi Erik welcome to this tutorial\n",
    "It’s not that hard, you just add more arguments to the function definition, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning from a function\n",
    "A function runs until the end of that function, after which Python returns to where the function was called from. In the following example, I want you to predict the output before you run it:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Predict the output of this program\n",
    "Did your expectations match with reality? If so, you have a good understanding of how a function call works. Some people at this point expect to see the text “Let’s greet the entire world” twice. If you are one of them, don’t worry and keep reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python keeps track of the point where the function is called. In our case, it’s at line 5. Once called, Python runs the block of code inside the function line by line until it reaches the end of that function. And once the end of the function is reached, Python jumps back to the line right after where the function was called from: line 6!\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: a function call is not a jump or ‘go to’, but a call to a piece of reusable code, which returns to where it was called from. A function call is also an expression: most functions return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning values\n",
    "So far, our function only printed something and returned nothing. What makes functions a lot more usable, is the ability to return a value. Let’s see an example of how a Python function can return a value:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how you return a value from a Python function\n",
    "As you can see, we use the keyword return to return a value from our function. Functions that return a value can be used everywhere we can use an expression. In the above example, we can assign the returned value to the variable result."
